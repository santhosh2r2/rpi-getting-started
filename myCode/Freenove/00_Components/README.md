# Electronic Components

## LED

- LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. LED will shine only if the long pin of LED is connected to the positive electrode and the short pin is connected to negative electrode.
- This is also the features of the common diode. Diode works only if the voltage of its positive electrode is higher than its negative electrode.
- The LED can not be directly connected to power supply, which can damage component. A resistor with certain resistance must be connected in series in the circuit of LED.
