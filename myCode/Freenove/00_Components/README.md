# Electronic Components

## LED

- LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. LED will shine only if the long pin of LED is connected to the positive electrode and the short pin is connected to negative electrode.
- This is also the features of the common diode. Diode works only if the voltage of its positive electrode is higher than its negative electrode.
- The LED can not be directly connected to power supply, which can damage component. A resistor with certain resistance must be connected in series in the circuit of LED.

## RGB LED

- RGB LED has integrated 3 LEDs that can respectively emit red, green and blue light. And it has 4 pins. The long pin (1) is the common port, that is, 3 LED 's positive or negative port. The RGB LED with common positive port and its symbol are shown below. We can make RGB LED emit various colors of light by controlling these 3 LEDs to emit light with different brightness.
- Red, green, and blue light are called 3 primary colors. When you combine these three primary-color light with different brightness, it can produce almost all kinds of visible lights. Computer screens, single pixel of cell phone screen, neon, and etc. are working under this principle.

## Resistor

Resistor is an electrical component that limits or regulates the flow of current in an electronic circuit.

## ADC

- ADC, Analog-to-Digital Converter, is a device used to convert analog to digital.
- The range of the ADC module is 8 bits, that means the resolution is 2^8=256, and it represents the range (here is 3.3V) will be divided equally to 256 parts.
- The analog of each range corresponds to one ADC values. So the more bits ADC has, the denser the partition of analog will be, also the higher precision of the conversion will be.
